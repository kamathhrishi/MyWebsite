<p style="text-align:justify">I'm currently enrolled in the Cybersecurity Master's program at the University of Delaware, with my expected graduation date set for May 2025.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I am looking for Internships for Summer 2024 or Fall 2024.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My technical interests are in Deep Learning(especially Large Language Models) and Privacy Preserving Systems.
In Privacy Preserving Systems, I am specifically interested in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Secure Multi Party Computation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">At the University of Delaware, I serve as a Student Researcher at the <a target="_blank" href="https://crpl.cis.udel.edu/">Computational Research and Programming Lab</a>. My focus involves working on code generation utilizing LLMs.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I used to work at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.colorit.io/">Ederlabs</a> on privacy preserving Machine learning (PPML).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I was also core member of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openmined.org/">Openmined</a> Secure Multiparty Computation team. I used to review pull requests, write functionality and help maintain in SyMPC library. SyMPC allows computing over encrypted data, that includes training and evaluating neural networks. The library used a Pytorch backend.</p>


<p style="text-align:justify">I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Apart from technical interests and work, I am curious about several things and spend time reading about various topics. I am especially interested in capital markets and business. I closely follow the Indian markets and invest using fundamental analysis. </p>
