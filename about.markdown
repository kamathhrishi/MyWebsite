I currently work at Ederlabs on privacy preserving Machine learning (PPML).

I am also a member of [Openmined](https://www.openmined.org/) SyMPC team.

My interests are in Machine Learning, Privacy Preserving Systems and Software Engineering.<br />
In Privacy Preserving Systems, I am specifically interested in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Multi Party Computation.

I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020.
