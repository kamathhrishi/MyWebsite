<p style="text-align:justify">I currently work at Ederlabs on privacy preserving Machine learning (PPML).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">I am also a core member of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openmined.org/">Openmined</a> Secure Multiparty Computation team.
<br/>
I review pull requests, write functionality and help maintain in SyMPC library. SyMPC allows computing over encrypted data, and to train and evaluate neural networks in Pytorch.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My technical interests are in Machine Learning, Privacy Preserving Systems and Software Engineering.<br />
In Privacy Preserving Systems, I am specifically interested in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Secure Multi Party Computation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Apart from technical interests and work, I like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.zomato.com/users/hrishikesh-kamath-140752612/reviews">exploring different cuisines of food</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/145917634-hrishikesh-kamath">reading books</a>. <br/> I am curious about several things and spend time reading about various topics like economics, politics and business. That wasn't an exhaustive list of topics :). Sometimes I watch TV shows. </p>

<p>The second man to walk on the moon saw a presentation of mine :P </p>
