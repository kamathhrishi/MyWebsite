<p style="text-align:justify">I currently work at Ederlabs on privacy preserving Machine learning (PPML).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I am also a core member of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openmined.org/">Openmined</a> Secure Multiparty Computation team.
I review pull requests, write functionality and help maintain in SyMPC library. It allows computing over encrypted data, and to train and evaluate neural networks in Pytorch.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">My interests are in Machine Learning, Privacy Preserving Systems and Software Engineering.<br />
In Privacy Preserving Systems, I am specifically interested in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Secure Multi Party Computation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020.</p>
