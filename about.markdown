I currently work at Ederlabs on privacy preserving Machine learning (PPML).

I am also a core member of [Openmined](https://www.openmined.org/) Secure Multiparty Computation team.
I review pull requests, write functionality and help maintain in SyMPC library. It allows computing over encrypted data, and to train and evaluate neural networks in Pytorch.

My interests are in Machine Learning, Privacy Preserving Systems and Software Engineering.<br />
In Privacy Preserving Systems, I am specifically interested in Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Multi Party Computation.

I graduated from RV College of Engineering, Bangalore with a Bachelors in Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in 2020.
